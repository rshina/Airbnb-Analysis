# AIRBNB ANALYSIS


ABOUT PROJECT:


        This project aims to analyze Airbnb data (Exctracted from githb Respiratory), 
        perform data cleaning and preparation, 
        develop interactive geospatial visualizations, 
        and create dynamic plots to gain insights into pricing variations, 
        availability patterns, and location-based trends.
        Utilize Tableau or Power BI to create a comprehensive dashboard that presents key insights from the analysis. 


        
#Libraries/Modules needed for the project:


      *import git
      *import pandas 
      *import json
      *import seaborn 
      *import matplotlib.pyplot 
      *import plotly.express 
      *import numpy 
      *import streamlit 
      *from PIL import 
      *import requests
      *import plotly.graph_objects as go  



#Tools Used for this Project:


           *Python
           *VS CODE
           *Github
           *Streamlit
           *Tableau

#Workflow :


         There are 5 Stages in airbnb analysis project


STEP1:


            Clone the airbnb data from github respiratory.("https://github.com/neelabalan/mongodb-sample-dataset.git)


STEP2:


         Clean the Airbnb dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming data types.
         Prepare the dataset for EDA and visualization tasks, ensuring data integrity and consistency.


STEP3:


         Develop a streamlit web application that utilizes the geospatial data from the Airbnb dataset 
         to create interactive maps

STEP4:


          Use the cleaned data to analyze and visualize how prices vary across different locations, property types,Price. 
          Create dynamic plots and charts that enable users to explore price trends,
          and correlations with other variables.


STEP5:



          Utilize Tableau or Power BI to create a comprehensive dashboard that presents key insights from the analysis. 
          Combine different visualizations, such as maps, charts, and tables, 
          to provide a holistic view of the Airbnb dataset and its patterns.
